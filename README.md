## Youtube Video Browser with React.js and RapidAPI

This repository contains the source code for a web application built with React.js that allows users to browse and view videos using an external API accessed through RapidAPI.

**View the Website:https://sou-youtube2.netlify.app/**

**Features:**

* Search for videos by keyword.
* Display a list of video search results with thumbnails and titles.
* Play embedded videos on the video detail page. (Source of the videos depends on the integrated RapidAPI API)
* (Optional) Implement basic functionality like playlists or displaying related videos (can be added in future versions).


**Getting Started:**

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system
* A RapidAPI account and API key for the desired external API

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your RapidAPI API key:

   ```
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_rapidapi_key
   ```

   Replace `your_rapidapi_key` with your actual RapidAPI API key.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start  # or yarn start
   ```

   This will start the server, typically running on port 3000 by default (you can check the code for confirmation).

**Usage:**

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate URL) in your web browser.
2. Use the search bar to enter a keyword and search for videos.
3. Click on a video thumbnail to view the video details and play the embedded video.

* React.js (frontend)
